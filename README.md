# Sentiric Marketplace Service

**Description:** A platform service for discovering, distributing, and potentially monetizing agents, connectors, and other extensions within the Sentiric ecosystem.

**Core Responsibilities:**
*   Listing and managing available extensions (e.g., agent templates, connector configurations).
*   Providing an interface for users to browse, select, and deploy these extensions to their Sentiric instances.
*   (Future) Implementing payment or licensing mechanisms for extensions.

**Technologies:**
*   Node.js (for backend API)
*   JavaScript/TypeScript (for frontend UI, e.g., React, Vue)
*   Database connection (e.g., PostgreSQL).

**API Interactions (As an API Provider & Client):**
*   **As a Provider:** Exposes APIs for `sentiric-dashboard-ui` or external developers to manage and browse extensions.
*   **As a Client:** Interacts with `sentiric-agent-service` (to deploy new agents) and `sentiric-connectors-service` (to configure new connectors).

**Local Development:**
1.  Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/sentiric/sentiric-marketplace-service.git`
2.  Navigate into the directory: `cd sentiric-marketplace-service`
3.  Install backend dependencies: `npm install` (for Node.js backend).
4.  Install frontend dependencies (if separate): `cd frontend && npm install`.
5.  Create a `.env` file from `.env.example` to configure database and other service URLs.
6.  Start backend and frontend: `npm start` (backend) and `npm run dev` (frontend).

**Configuration:**
Refer to `config/` directory and `.env.example` for service-specific configurations, including database connection details and integration settings.

**Deployment:**
Designed for containerized deployment (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes), potentially with separate frontend and backend deployments. Refer to `sentiric-infrastructure`.
